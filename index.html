        Tiger Sugar is popular in Taipei and is well regarded for their brown sugar bubble tea. The store has care for the boba for 8 hours. They also used a 8 hour method to make their own tapioca pearls. Tiger Sugar's brown sugar flavor is so iconic that they've even released Tiger Sugar flavored popcorn, ice pops and other snacks for when the drink alone just won't cut it. You must visit this shop if you happen to see it.

      <p class = "text-muted">
        The Nijubashi Bridge connects the Imperial Palace front Plaza called the Kokyo Gaien and the Imperial Place over a deep moat. It was once a wooden bridge with two levels which is why it was named Nijubashi or "double-bridge".

The wooden bridge was replaced with a steel bridge in 1964. It is best viewed from the large plaza called the Kokyo Gaien. Two bridges make up the entrance of the inner palace grounds. The stone bridge in front is called the Meganebashi or the Eyeglass Bridge and the other is the two-level steel Nijubashi Bridge. Most of the times the Nijubashi Bridge is normally not open. Only when there are special ceremonies or only twice a year, the Nijubashi Bridge opens to the public.

       <p>I watched this movie about 3 years ago so I can't really remember anything, but I remember that it was a good movie. My favorite part in it was when they were in this big battle and it was just chaos all around. It's still a good movie to watch although I watched it 3 years ago.</p>

       <p>I watched Shang-Chi not so long ago. It is a highly rated movie and I recommend seeing the bus scene. It was the best marvel movie in 2021.
          It is about a martial arts master Shang-Chi aka (me) Sean, he also worked as a valat to hide his identity.</p>
